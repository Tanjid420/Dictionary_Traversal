 <h1> Features and Functionalities </h1>
 
 <hr>
 
<h4> Technologies </h4>
 
We have used both basic and intermediate HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript for Front-End works and for the Back-End we have used Node.js, Express.js, Restful APIs and MongoDB for    handling the Database. We have also taken help from some templates. 
 
 <h4> Features </h4>
 
 <ul style="list-style-type:disk;">
  <li>You can know the meanings/definitions, synonyms, antonyms etc of your desired word from any article or link.</li>
  <li>You can add words of your known and also hear the exact pronunciation of those word.</li>
  <li>You can play different types of word games too.</li>
  <li>You can see the leaderboard where you can know your position based on how many words you know.</li>
</ul>  
 
 <h4> Functionalities </h4>
 
 <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>By pasting any url of a website in the search bar of the website gives you access to scrape all the articles from that website and whenever you hover your pointer/cursor over a word, you can see the meanings, synonyms and antonyms of the word.</li>
  <li>You can add the word on your own portion of the leaderboard by right clicking on the word and pressing "Add to list" button. Doing that will also let you know the exact pronunciation of the word.</li>
  <li>You can play games like Word Puzzle which will help you to expand your knowledge and a Quiz Game to enrich your vocabulary and many more.</li>
  <li> You can see the leaderboard where words will be automatically added on your coloumn with you name and rank, whenever you add a word to your list. Every time you sign up with a new account a new table will be added for that account. </li>
